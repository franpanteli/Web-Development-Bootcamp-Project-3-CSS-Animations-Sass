<h1> Project 3 - ohmyfood </h1>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>'ohmyfood' is the third web development project I completed during the twelve-week AMSxOpenClassrooms web development skills bootcamp. This was produced to integrate Sass animations with the HTML and CSS skills acquired from the previous project. The primary aim of this was to develop these skills by completing the course material and to apply them by producing a webpage for a gourmet restaurant app, with various animations created using CSS (Sass). This project was versioned using GitHub and was created by converting the mockup of the webpage into a mobile-first web application. This mockup was provided in Figma and problem solving sessions were conducted for this project during mentoring sessions and webinars included as part of the bootcamp. This was finally assessed in a 15-minute oral presentation conducted on the OpenClassrooms platform. </p>
</p>

<h3>Webpage Links</h3>
<p>I normally deploy my projects using Netlify and had initially deployed the project using this platform. Since the project milestone guide suggests using GitHub Pages to deploy the project, this has project has been deployed twice for the sake of practice. The links to its two deployments are below, although GitHub Pages is the preferred method as part of this skills bootcamp. 
<ul>
  <li>Netlify: fran-web-dev-bootcamp-project-3.netlify.app </li>
  <li>GitHub Pages: https://franpanteli.github.io/Web-Development-Bootcamp-Project-3-Menu-Website/</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ohmyfood Public Speaking Skills Assessment</h3>
This project was examined in a 30 minute oral presentation I gave on the OpenClassrooms platform, to develop public speaking and presentation skills. My flashcards from this assessment are available in the directory called 'assessment.'
  
<h3>Web Development Bootcamp Notes (Extension)</h3>
<p>Three new courses were covered as part of this project. These are detailed below and were provided on the OpenClassrooms platform to develop Sass, versioning and animation skills with CSS.Their contents are described below</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Manage Your Code Project With Git and GitHub </strong> - the first course was a 6-hour long course on Git and GitHub. This was taught by Max Wardeh and covered Git commands, branching systems, using Git Reset and troubleshooting</li>
  <li><strong>Produce Maintainable CSS With Sass</strong> - the second was a 15-hour long course which included 7-1 file patterning, BEM selectors, specificity, CSS Preprocessors, Sass variables / extensions / functions, mixins, conditionals, advanced Sass data types, loops, breakpoints, and Autoprefixer. This course was produced by Pat Gerke</li>

  <li><strong>Create Modern CSS Animations</strong> - this was a 15-hour-long course covering CSS transitions / transformations, the 12 principles of animation, timing functions, opacity, anchor points using transform-origin, Chrome DevTools, CSS keyframes and Chrome's Animation tool. This course was also produced by Pat Gerke</li>
</ul> 
<p>The full contents of my notes from this bootcamp are below:</p>

<h3>For the Loader</h3>
<p>This contains a list of resources for reference which was provided during a live session included as part of the bootcamp. It was suggested to refer to these resources when adding in the loader for the homepage of the ohmyfood website (in the index.html file for the project). These resources are listed below </p>
<ul>
  <li> https://loading.io/css/ <- for loaders with html and CSS which can be used</li>
  <li> https://codebeautify.org/css-to-sass-converter <- to convert CSS into Sass </li>
</ul>
<p>There are in-depth comments in the index.html file of the project which detail the problem-solving thought processes used to create this loader for the homepage of the project.</p>
<h3>Project File Tree (Extension)</h3>

<p>The file tree for this project is below and was included as an extension to the project. The file tree for the second project was included in its starter files, although this was not the case for this project. This file tree was produced by studying the course material and project milestone guide. This was a more complex problem to solve, given that this project introduced Sass, versioning with GitHub and had five html pages in comparison to the second project which had one. This tree is annotated with the thought processes used to structure it.</p>

<p>Note: this is an earlier version of the file tree for the project (further updates were later added). The styles.css file was also initially in the assets folder as suggested in the project milestone guide, although this was causing issues with compiling the Sass. To resolve this issue, a solution was devised where the compiled css was placed at the same level in the file tree as the index.html file. This resulted in Sass which compiled into this css file and the html files linking correctly to it.</p>
