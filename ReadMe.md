<ul>
	<li> index.html <- this is the html for the main webpage 
	<li> assets <- this is the directory which contains the assets (the CSS file and images for the page)
	<li> Sass <- this is the directory which contains the Sass files for the project. This contains seven directories, listed below. The Sass file names within these take the format of '_variables.scss' and are prefixed with an underscore because they are partials included as part of a larger codebase 
	<ol>	
		<li>Base <- this contains the files that define the foundation of the site, such as the typography etc which are applied site-wide (all of the html files in the webpage have these in common) </li>
		<li>Utils <- is where variables, functions, mixins, and %placeholders for extensions are stored, if used. The order of @imports for the files this directory contains in comparison to the one the main directory contains has to be -> variables, functions, mixins, placeholders </li>
		<li>Layout <- is where BEM blocks which contain reusable elements for the webpage are stored -> e.g a form or header for large layouts</li>
		<li>Components <- this is where Sass for BEM blocks that are more self-contained is stored -> such as Sass for buttons</li>
		<li>Pages <- this contains blocks of code that only apply to a single page. E.g if the homepage has an element on it which does not apply elsewhere to the page -> elements which are unique to one of the pages on the site</li>
		<li>Themes <- this is where code which styles the webpage e.g for different holiday themes is stored -> these styles are defined in this directory, and then applied at the required times</li>
		<li>Vendors <- this contains Sass from third party vendors which is used in the project. These vendors include libaries such as Bootstrap or jquery UI -> essentially  any CSS that has originated from outside of the project, which is used to speed up the site creation</li>
	</ol>
	<li> restaurants <- this is the directory which contains the html files for the restaurant pages in the project (ohmyfood is a site where clients can order food from restauraunts, four different ones in this case and one for the desktop version)
<ul>

In VSCode 
<ul>
	<li>To open the terminal -> command shift p -> create new terminal</li>
	<li><u>To open a file using the terminal (in VSCode)</u> -> cd into that directory with the file, then <u> 'open file_name' </u><- chatGPT says to use 'code file_name' for this,  but it doesn't work -> the suggestion which does is 'open file_name''</li>
</ul>
