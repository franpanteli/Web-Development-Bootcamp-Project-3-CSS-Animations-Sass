    <!-- The thought process used to create the loading animation -->
    <!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
    <!--
            The suggested approach 
                -> it was suggested in a live skills session to use a loading animation for the page from the LOADING.IO (Pure CSS Loader) site
                -> to convert the css from this into Sass using an online converter 
                -> this project uses text rather than this method, as this allows for more specific design choices 

            Design choices which were selected for this loader
                -> the colour themes used
                    -> there were three colours listed in the creative brief for the project 
                    -> two of these were used in a radial gradient for the background of the loading animation 
                        -> this produces a more symmetrical appearance than using a linear gradient 
                    -> the third was used in the text for this animation 
                -> the text
                    -> the font used for the homepage loader text is the same as the ohmyfood logo 
                        -> this creates homogeneity across the site 
                    -> content 
                        -> the timing for this animation is long enough for customers to read it 
                        -> this text said "Hungry? We've got gourmet" in a prototyped version of the project, since this project lists fine-dining 
                            restaurants 
                            -> this was changed to "Loading", since the webpage is a mobile-first application and the text was not fitting in the 
                                centre of the page
                            -> using less text in this way was a simpler solution in comparison to re-altering the Sass for its positioning 

            The approach used to create this
                Two divs were created, one embedded inside the other 
                    -> a div was created with a class which specially targets the background 
                        -> this class is called the "loader" class  
                    -> another div was created which targets the text for that loading animation 	
                        -> this class is called the "word" class 

                The "loader" class 
                    -> this is the class which targets the entire loading background 
                    -> positioning 
                        -> of the entire background -> the position of this element was fixed -> so that the background obstructs the entire screen if the 
                            users scroll 
                        -> of the elements in that background -> the text which is contained in this background is a block element (it's contained in a div), 
                            so a grid was used to position it into the centre of the page 
                    -> background colour 
                        -> see the notes for the design section above (radial gradient, in the colour scheme detailed in the creative brief)
                        -> this was entirely opaque -> to avoid the homepage being distracting 
                    -> inset 
                        -> the inset of 0 <- this class property sets the background for the loader to take up 100% of the height and width of the viewport 
                            for the browser window (stack overflow)
                    -> z-index 
                        -> this line positions the background of the loader animation to be in front of the homepage 
                
                The "word" class
                    -> this is the class which formats the text for the loading animation 
                    -> this sets its colour and font size, explained above in the comments for "design choices used"
                    -> since this class was embedded in the class which set the background for the loading animation, the class which targets the text itself 
                        is a lot more simple
                        -> the animation isn't directly applied to this class <- it's applied to the class which targets the div which is placed around the 
                            background 
                        -> this div just targets the text, because it's embedded inside the div which targets the loading effect on the background 

                Animating the "loader" class 
                    Why a keyframe was used for the loader animation 
                        -> this is the class for the background of the loading animation 
                        -> the z-index of this class was originally set to 1 (so it was in front of the content for the webpage)
                        -> a keyframe -> rather than transition was used for this animation 
                        -> since the trigger event is the reloading of the page (rather than a user interaction)
                        -> in the Sass for the loader animation -> this is where the keyframe which animates it was used 
                            -> the keyframe itself (go-away) was also defined later in the compiled css (Sass)

                    The keyframe which makes the background disappear (go-away)
                        -> this keyframe takes 0 seconds to complete (the loader background disappears immediately), and after a time delay of 2.9s
                            -> in between the requested time limit of 1.5 and 3s for this loading animation 
                        -> this moves the background of the loading animation to be behind the content of the page (transitioning its z index from 1 to -1)
                        -> this also transitions the opacity of this element to 0
                        -> in other words -> it makes the background of the loader disappear -> by moving it behind the content of the homepage and making it 
                            transparent 
                        -> this takes no time to run, but if its duration were increased, then the styles which are applied 0% of the way through this 
                            keyframe would be more relevant (you can get rid of the styling 0% of the way through the keyframe for this and it does nothing)
                        -> go-away and the background 
                            -> go-away was used to target the "loader" class, not the "word" class
                            -> the "loader" class targets the entire background
                            -> in other words, we're taking the entire background, waiting 2.9 seconds and then using this animation to move the entire 
                                thing behind the homepage and make it transparent

                    - this flexes the two items into a row -> and then justifies them into the centre of the page

                        These were positioned with negative margins 
                            -> the purple circles were moved to the left by using negative margins
                                -> relative positioning of these elements was initially used -> although this was later changed to negative margins 
                            -> so we have all of the elements in one of the list items, flexed to the start of the box in a row

                            -> since the list elements were flexed, increasing their widths at this point of the page resizing would enable them to start

        About this section of the homepage

            -> the cards in the previous section were made using list elements

        -> there is a larger div which is around all 4 of the Restaurant cards
        -> so we have a big div around 4 little divs
        -> each of those little divs is a Restaurant card
        -> all of these cards have a similar structure, so the later comments go through the html for the first one (Kitchen West)
        -> the classes which were used to target these cards follow the BEM naming convention 
            -> the class which is around all 4 of the little divs is called 'restaurants_container'
            -> and the classes which target the little divs nested inside it follow a similar naming style, as per the BEM naming convention

        -> mobile and desktop mockups of these cards were provided -> we were expected to choose and implement their behaviour as the webpage 
            expanded past the mobile breakpoint and into the tablet breakpoint
        -> this was a mobile first website -> and so the process used to do this was different in comparison to the second project, 
            which was desktop-first and expanding to large desktops
        -> the class which was placed around the little divs for the Restaurant cards was the same class used to add these media queries 
            -> when the webpage expands to the tablet breakpoint, the widths of the cards expands and their widths fill the page 
            -> once we reach past the tablet breakpoint, the class which targets these cards adds in a grid using flex -> to force 
                them into a 2x2 matrix (with two rows of equal width)
            -> each of the Restaurant cards takes up a quadrant of this grid. These quadrants were separated by adding margins around the boxes

                                <!-- 
                                    The animation for the hover state of the heart icons 
                                    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
                                        
                                        The heart icon was inserted fromt he font awesome libary
                                        -> these icons were inserted using the font awesome libary
                                            -> there is a line earlier in the header of the code which links to this libary and allows its icons 
                                                to be imported 
                                        -> an animation was created which targeted the icon in its hover state

                                        Why transitions were used for these icons 
                                            -> two methods were suggested to add in these animations on the OpenCleassrooms platform 
                                                -> @keyframes and transitions
                                                -> seeing as there were two states (either the icon was being hovered over or it wasn't), a 
                                                    transition efffect was added in using css / Sass to add create this effect
                                                -> the two states which are being trainsitioned between for this icon -> are it in its hover state, 
                                                    or in its normal state 
                                                    -> it's placed inslide a link for the page, so if it's clicked on then the page will redirect 
                                                    -> to enable it to be permanently clickable -> it could be placed in front of the <a> tags which 
                                                        create these links -> e.g using absolute positinoing (as with the 'New' label)
                                            -> there are two (one for before the transition and one for after the transition)


                                        Why there are two icons in the html, but one on the rendered webpage (to create the transition)
                                            -> on the final webpage, there is one icon 
                                            -> in the html for this below, there are two 
                                                -> the first is the appearance of the icon in its normal state
                                                        -> this icon is positioned absolutely (otherwise it disappears out of the Restaurant card)
                                                        -> we want its position to be relative to the Restaurant card it's in (not the entire webpage)
                                                -> the second is the appearance of the icon in its second (hover) state
                                                        -> we are using the same icon (the fa heart icon), with the html icon <i> tags 
                                                        -> one of the differences is -> we are now targeting it with the fa-solid attribute
                                                            -> the entire icon in the secondary state is solid 
                                                -> the second icon is being targeted with the 'my-heart-full' class          

                                        Using the 'my-heart-full' class to create the transition for this icon in its hover state
                                            -> the icons for the two states (before and after the transition of the icon) were added in next to each other in the 
                                                html below 
                                                    -> we have before and after the transition, as two separate icons added above each other in the html
                                            -> the class which was used to create the transition between them was called the 'my-heart-full' class 
                                                -> this class targets the last version of the icon -> the second one, after it's transitioned
                                                -> so we have two different icons (before and after the transition) 
                                                    -> the class which adds in the transition is added onto the icon in the html which represents the full heart
                                                        (this is the icon after the transition)
                                            -> how this class works is 
                                                -> there is the class in its regular state, and then there is the class in its hover state

                                                The class in its regular state
                                                    -> the regular state sets the behaviour of the full heart -> the opacity of that is completely 0 (so in its 
                                                        initial state it can't be seen)
                                                        -> then a transition is added in to transition this opacity 
                                                        -> so when the heart goes to the second state (the hover state) -> this is the property which is being 
                                                            transitioned 
                                                    -> the pink background is also set, which is the same gradient that was exported from Figma 
                                                        -> there are also multiple prefixes in the compiled css, which enable the code to use vendor prefixes before 
                                                            properties are made more open source (this is detailed in the Sass course notes in the project repository)
                                                
                                                The class in its hover state
                                                    -> this sets the opacity of the background for the icon in its hover state -> 1 
                                                    -> two transition effects were added in for this -> to transition back to the regular state of the icon 
                                                        -> in other words, two states (before and after the icon is hovered over)
                                                        -> so we have a transition to go from before the ison is being hovered over 
                                                            -> and another to go from after to before 
                                                        -> this is why the solution devised for this adds in a transition property in the compiled css - both 
                                                            to the code before the transition, and to the code after the transition
                                                            -> transitioning back the opacity 
                                                            -> before to after, and then after to before -> the use of two transition properties - and both times 
                                                                transitioning the opacity of the icon 
                                                        -> the background gradient of the icon has also been set here -> in the css for the initial and final css
                                                    -> since two icons were used (one for the before and after state of the animation), the compiled css positions the 
                                                        second icon with a background-position property, to be in the same position as the first icon
                                                            -> this way the second one is lying on top of the first one -> and it's only visible once it's being hovered
                                                                over

                            -> the media queries which target the footer elements below the tablet breakpoint were a lot more lenient, in the 
                                sense that they were not set to justify those elements to the right of the page and into one row 
                            -> the approach which was used for this was to just flex those footer elements into a row, below the tablet 
                                breakpoint region 
                                    -> then those elements start to stack to match the mockup of the footer in Figma

                                -> in other words -> from the mobile to the tablet region -> we are just flexing those list elements into a row 
                                    -> since it's the mobile region, those elements start to stack in the footer (as per the Figma mockup)
                                    -> they don't flow over the top of the footer, because the stylings and dimensions for the mockup were used for 
                                        this 
                                -> then as we're expanding the page into the tablet breakpoint region, the media queries which target the class 
                                    around these elements become stricter
                                    -> since we have the space on the page, we're now justifying all of those elements into a row, and pushing them

                                        -> and these media queries have all been set for the same class <- which is the footer class
