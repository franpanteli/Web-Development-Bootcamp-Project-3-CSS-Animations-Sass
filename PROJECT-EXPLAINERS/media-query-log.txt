OUTLINE OF THIS FILE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a log of where the different media queries for the project can be found in its sass. These queries were designed using a mobile-first approach. The file tree for the final Sass of the project is as follows:
.
├── components
│   ├── _heart_animation.scss < NO MEDIA QUERIES 
│   └── _restaurant_cards.scss <- ONE 
├── layouts
│   ├── _footer.scss <- TWO 
│   ├── _header.scss <- THREE
│   ├── _loading_animations.scss <- NO MEDIA QUERIES 
│   └── _pages.scss
└── utils
    ├── _keyframes.scss <- NO MEDIA QUERIES
    ├── _mixins.scss <- NO MEDIA QUERIES
    └── _variables.scss <- NO MEDIA QUERIES

The Sass map for the project in the same repository as this txt file contains more information about which Sass is contained in each of these partials. This is a log of all of the media queries which this Sass contains and where in the Sass they are located. 

ONE, MEDIA QUERIES IN '_restaurant_cards.scss'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> there are two uses of media queries in this scss file
	-> the first is for the large container which is around the four restaurant cards on the homepage
	-> the second is for the box which is around all of the restaurant cards on this page 
-> these media queries are for the restaurant cards -> only for the index.html file of the project (its homepage)

TWO, MEDIA QUERIES IN '_footer.scss'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> there are three uses of media queries in this scss file 
	-> the first is to move all of the list elements which make up the footer into a row above the tablet breakpoint 
	-> the second is to do this using a flex display (the first is telling it which direction to flex the footer elements into, a row reverse)
	-> the third is targeting each of the list elements which make up the footer -> rather than the entire container which is around them 
-> the different uses of media queries here aim to target the container around all of the footer elements -> and then to target the individual elements themselves
	-> these are separated out in the Sass -> so that the media queries and styling for a given element are in the same place 
	-> this is in comparison to the second project where Sass was not used -> and the media queries for the project went at the end of the whole css file 
		-> the media queries are being split out and used for the individual elements in the Sass -> and are being put there when the styling for those elements is defined 
		-> rather than at the end of the css in their own individual section 

THREE, MEDIA QUERIES IN '_header.scss'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> this is for the header of the index.html file in the project 
-> there are three uses of media queries in this scss file 
	-> the first use of media queries targets the container which is around all of the cards with the purple circles, as well as the text which says 'Restaurants' in that section on the project homepage 
		-> altering the padding for this section of the webpage above the tablet breakpoint region 
	-> the second is for the container which is around all three of those cards
		-> flexing them into a row above the tablet breakpoint region 
		-> for more information on this, refer to the comments around this section on the index.html file for the project 
	-> then the third use of media queries in this section is for each of those cards themselves
		-> fixing the widths of the cards -> to ensure that they are stacking
