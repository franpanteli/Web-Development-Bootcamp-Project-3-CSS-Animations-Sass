One of the challenges faced during this project was that multiple changes were made to its mockup. This created technical challenges when planning the implementation of several features across the site, since the mockup of these elements had changed while the code for them was being produced. One notable example of this was the spacing between the four restaurant cards on the project homepage (index.html file) of the project. These cards were spaced further apart in the project mockup after the completion of its code here. The spacing between these cards in this project was therefore kept equal in the x and y direction above the tablet breakpoint region, while other changes which were made to the mockup were added in.
