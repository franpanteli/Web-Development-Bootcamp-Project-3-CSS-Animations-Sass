<!-- Animating the content for this webpage <- transitioning in 
    -> note 
      -> this animation was created using a transition 
      -> this was initially only added to the content in the beige section in the middle of the menu pages 
      -> these comments below refer to the menu class -> which is where this effect was initially added
      -> this was later extended to account for the entire page (but the transition effect is the same)
        -> this is why these notes refer to the menu section 
    -> the menu class targets the div which is placed around the content for the menu 
    -> in the beige section of the menu pages, the div which is placed around all of the content 
    -> a transition is added onto this class 
      -> so, all of the content in the beige section is surrounded by a div
      -> that div is targeted with the menu class 
      -> this is the class which is being targeted for an animation 
      -> that animation was done with keyframes and not transitions (unlike the heart animation used throughout the project)
        -> this animation does not have a trigger (the trigger for the heart animation is the user hovering over that element) <- that's an event 
        -> the event which triggers the animation which is created by this class for the content of the menu is triggered when the page reloads 
        -> which is why keyframes (and not transitions were used to create it)
    -> in the compiled css for this 
      -> we have the menu class <- the class which targets the div which is placed around all of the content in the beige section of the menu pages 
        -> also note how this is reused across the 4 menu pages (they were all based off of the same template, which was initialised in the html 
        file for the Kitchen West menu)
      -> so in the compiled css, we have the menu class 
        -> then we have the animation which is being added to it <- this is being done in two stages 
          -> the first is to define the keyframes for its transition (this is called menuFadeIn) 
            -> this includes two points, 0% of the way through the animation and 100% of the way through the animation 
            -> 0% of the way through the animation, the opacity of the elements it's being applied to is 0, and 100% of the way through the animation, 
            the content its being applied to becomes completely opaque  
          -> the second is to use that keyframe on the class which is placed around the div for the elements we want to target 
            -> in this case it's the menu class <- because this is placed around the content in the beige part of the menu pages which we want the 
                animation to apply to 
            -> this is done in the css (using the keyframe animation) by the line 'animation: menuFadeIn 4s forwards;' <- under the menu section of 
              the webpage, use this keyframe, make the animation take 4 seconds and run it forwards (start with the content transparent and make it 
              opaque, rather than the other way round)
    -> the important points are 
      -> the reason a keyframe and not a transition is being used for this is because the trigger event for the start of the animation is the reloading 
        of the page, not a user interacting with it 
        -> you don't have two states to transition between -> just an animation you want to apply when the page reloads (rather than before and after 
          a user has interacted with it, like the heart element)
      -> then there is how it's defined and used 
        -> the content we want to animate on the html page is surrounded by a div -> that div has a class which is associated with it 
        -> we define the keyframe at the end of the compiled css / Sass <- and then we apply it to the class which targets the content in html which 
          we want to annotate 
          -> and we target it using the animation property 
          -> the keyframe for this was defined at the end of the compiled css / Sass for organisational reasons (rather than specificity in this case) 
            <- this is detailed in the Sass notes for the third project in this repository

        The file tree structure which enabled this image to be used
            About
              -> the files for the project were initially structured in a way which included the images in an assets folder, the html files, 
                  Sass files and others
              -> all of the content was in the project folder, although when using <img> tags to import the images in this folder - these
                  weren't showing on the page 
                when rendered in the browser 
              -> to rectify this challenge, the file tree structure for the contents of the project folder was changed to be more in line with 
                  the second project 
              -> the file tree for the second bootcamp project and this, the third therefore have commonalities, although the third project 
                  file structure has extra content (namely its sass directory)
          
            What the file tree for this project and the file tree for the second bootcamp project (Booki) have in common
              -> file tree <- opening a terminal, typing tree, dropping the project folder over the terminal for its directory and then hitting enter 
              -> the folder which contains the project images is placed in the same layer of the tree as the index.html file for the project
                -> so we have the index.html file for the project -> and then in the same level of the tree is the folder which contains the images 
                    for the project <- the html file is importing from that folder  
              -> this was the same approach used for the other html files for the third project 
                -> all of these html files were other pages of the website (one html file per page of the website)
                -> the other html files for the project were contained in their own folder 
                -> that was included relative to the main index.html file for the project in the same way that the directory which contained the image 
                  files was 
                -> this index.html file (in this case, for the third project) was the homepage for the website <- and the second project only contained 
                    one html file (the index.html file)
              -> problems weren't encountered with the styles.css file (the second project included this one layer into the file tree relative to the 
                  index.html file, and the third project included this in the same level of indentation) 
              -> the directory which contains the sass files for the project was also included on the same level of indentation as the index.html file, 
                  relatively speaking (although the second project didn't have sass)

    <!-- How the media queries for the beige section in the middle of the menu pages were created for this project 
		
          How they are working when you inspect the responsively of the middle section of the menu pages 
            -> it's hitting at the tablet breakpoint <- the same as the footer elements 
            -> taking up 100% of the width of the page, and then once the tablet breakpoint is hit, it takes up x% of the width of the page and has 
                fixed margins
            -> so any extra space given by expanding the screen goes to increasing the width of that section (rather than being added to the margins 
                on either side of it, as with the second project)

          And then in the compiled css <- for the entire beige sections of the menu pages  
            -> the css / Sass for the media queries for the large beige divs on the menu pages 
              -> which class they target and if they work as we thought they did 
              -> above the tablet breakpoint, add these margins to this section 
                -> it's for the container class, which is around the entire beige section on the menu page 
                -> for that section above the tablet breakpoint -> add in these margins
                -> the width of that container also isn't specified, which means that when the page is being expanded -> the extra space gets added to 
                  that beige container (and the widths of the margins around it stay fixed)
                -> media queries were added around the entire beige section 
                  -> and then they were also added in for the title at the top of it -> margin-left: auto; and margin-right: auto; <- this is what was done 
                    for the second project 
                  -> this is different, because the width of the margins are fixed, and the width of the content is changing as the page expands (rather than 
                    the other way round)
                  -> so in this case, in the media queries above the tablet breakpoint region for the beige section in the menu pages -> the width of the 
                    content isn't specified, just the widths of the margins which we want to in 
                  -> those are specified for the media queries above the tablet breakpoint region, and nothing is specified for everything below that point 
                  -> so as the webpage expands, the extra space which is given by its expansion will go to the content (and the margins will remain fixed in 
                    this case)
                -> these media queries (this time) are also targeting one section of the webpage (the beige for the menu html pages), rather than the entire 
                    content of the page 

          And then in the compiled css <- for the titles in the beige sections of the menu webpages 
            Which section is being targeted by these media queries 
              -> we were given the appearance for this title in the mockup of the menu pages on Figma, for the mobile and the desktop versions 
              -> the tablet breakpoint was used throughout the project as the point which the media queries targeted when making the webpage responsive 
              -> media queries for the footer of the menu pages were the same, and the headers didn't require them 
              -> in the beige section of the menu pages (the middle), one media query was added around that entire section 
                -> and then another was added to the header of those menus (inside the beige section)
                -> this is explaining the media queries for the header section inside those beige sections of the menu pages 

            How this is being targeted 
              -> the tablet breakpoint was again used (1024px)
              -> the class which this is used to target is the container_banner (this is the class which is placed around this header element, inside 
                the beige menu section)
              -> above the tablet breakpoint region, this content is then being centred 
                -> there are already margins which are added to the left of the icons in this header <- so they spread apart when they are justified 
                  into the centre of the page for this region 
                -> below this point, the items in this element are placed in a div without this query

                  The width of the div which contains both of these text elements 
                    Setting the width of this element, in comparison to the height 
                      -> this was one of the most important parameters which was changed for this element 
                      -> so, we have two text elements which are surrounded by this larger div and are being flexed into a column by it 
                      -> the larger div which surrounds those two elements is targeted by the class called 'choice__card__txt'
                      -> the width of that div was set very specifically 
                        -> it's height wasn't set -> it was placed around those two elements of text, which were given their own paddings 
                        -> the width of that div was set to auto -> with a flex property of 1 

                    The importance of setting this width to auto 
                      -> the width of this div <- containing the two pieces of text in the choice cards was set to auto 
                      -> out of all three elements in one of those choice cards (the text, the price and the green icon div), the width of this div 
                          is the only one which was set to auto 
                      -> this property allows the width of this element to change, based on what the browser renders 
                      -> animation compatibility 
                        -> the animation later added (and what we will explore later in these comments) operates when the div around the entire 
                            choice card is in its hover state
                        -> when that entire div is being hovered over, the element to the right of the choice card is being transitioned in 
                        -> when it is being transitioned in, the width of the entire choice card is remaining the same 
                        -> so setting the width of the div which is around both of the text elements equal to auto allows it to get smaller when the 
                            green div is being animated into the choice card on the far right 
                      -> since the width of the entire choice card is remaining the same, when it's being hovered over and the green icon is being 
                          transitioned in, the widths of one of the three elements which are in that choice card needs to reduce 
                      -> since the div with the text around it is the largest div in that entire choice card, setting its width equal to auto tells 
                          the browser to reduce its width by the width of the green div which is being transitioned in when it's in its hover state 
                      -> the widths of all of the other two items in that choice card are fixed 
                      -> giving the div which contains the text a flex value equal to 1 also tells that item to take up all of the rest of the space 
                          in the choice card
                        -> we're telling the browser to make its width take up the width of the entire choice card (from the flex value of 1), and 
                            then to reduce that value in case anything else happens 
                          -> in other words, ready for the green div to be transitioned in <- the width of that entire choice card remains the same, 
                              but the width of the div which is around the text the choice card contains is reducing because it's been set to auto 
                              -> and it's reducing to accommodate the width of the green div which is being transitioned in

              There are three elements in the choice card, and all are flexed into a row 
                -> the first was the div with the two pieces of text which were flexed into a column 
                -> all three elements in the choice card were flexed into a row 
                -> so the second element in it is the price of the dish (this element)

              The 'choice__card__price' class 
                -> the content for the price of the dish is placed into a span 
                -> and then the entire span has been wrapped inside a larger div
                -> that larger div is targeted by the 'choice__card__price' class 
                  -> when the entire choice card is being hovered over, there is a right padding on this price element 
                  -> that right padding is the distance in between the cost of the dish and the left of the green div which contains the tick for 
                      that element 
                  -> the span which contains the price of the dish was placed in a larger div, and that larger div was formatted into a square 
                  -> so that its left edges had the same padding as the padding between the price of the dish and the left most side of the green 
                      containing div 
                -> top padding was added to this div, to then move down the price contained by the span inside it 
                -> the width of this div is fixed -> so that the the animated green div comes in, the width of the first element in the choice 
                    card is forced to change 

              A span was used for this as this is an inline element, although a div could have also been used
                -> a span is also more semantic / specific to text than a div <- a div can contain an entire card
                -> if the price uses a span, it's also taking up the width of the content (rather than the entire width of the div which contains 
                    it) <- so it can be more easily moved around 
                -> then the div which surrounds that span was used to move the price into its centre in the x, and add padding to its top

            Summary of the animation for the green divs 
            -> the width of the div which contains all three elements doesn't change when it's being hovered over 
              -> it's width is fixed
              -> when the div which contains all three of those elements is in its hover state -> then the right-most element is being transitioned in 
                (i.e, the icon surrounded by the green container)
              -> in other words, anywhere over this entire div can be hovered over -> then this transition is triggered for the right margin of the green div 
              -> when the green div of that element has a margin which is equal to zero -> this is when that element is visible on the page
              -> when the margin of that green containing div is negative -> this is its default state -> which transitions it off of the page 
              -> so when the larger containing div is hovered over -> this is when the margins of the green div which contains the icon is transitioned to be 0 
                -> in other words -> it's no longer being pushed out of the larger div which contains it 
                -> so we have the hover state for the larger containing div which is around all three elements for that section 
                -> when that is in its hover state -> then we are transitioning the right margin of the green div to be 0 

            The div with the green tick 
              The green tick is a font awesome icon inside a div 
                -> so each choice card contains three elements -> all flexed into a row 
                -> this is the third element in that row -> the green tick which is inside it 
                -> this tick was inserted using a font awesome icon 
                  -> these could be imported into the html pages for the project because of a line which was included in their headers 
                  -> the html <I> tags represent these icons 
                -> each of these font awesome ticks was surrounded by a larger div 
                  -> the larger div is what is targeting that element with the animation, and turning it green 
                  -> the icon <I> tags inside it are what insert in the icon itself (in grey)
                  -> then the div which surrounds the icon targets it with a class which is turning it green, centring it and then animating it 

              How the green div was placed in relation to the choice card which contains it  
                -> the green box which is being transitioned in is a font awesome tick icon 
                      -> this was placed inside a div <-- this div formats the icon to be in the centre of a green box 
                      -> the right margin of that div is also negative
                        -> the value of that margin equals the width of the green container for the icon 
                        -> that green icon is on the right hand side of the containing div which it's being placed in 
                        -> so giving its right margin a negative value moves it out of the box 
                        -> in other words, the green div has been placed to the right of the containing div, and then been given negative margins 
                          in order to shift it out of that box 
                          -> the amount it's been shifted out by those negative margins is the same as its width -> so the entire thing disappears 
                            out of the larger containing div which it's in 
                        -> this is the value of that margin -> when the larger div which contains all three of those items isn't being hovered over 
                          -> the green div is there, it's just been moved out of the div which contains it so it's invisible 
                          -> and the left-most (first) element in that containing div has a width which is set to auto 
                        -> so if an element is transitioned into that entire div -> then the width of this first element will decrease to 
                            accommodate it 

            Adding a green animation to that div  
              What the transition effect used was, functionally   
                -> the width of the left most (first) element in the html for each of these cards was automatically determined 
                  -> so when we transition the green boxes with the icons in -> the width of of the left most box decreases to accommodate it 
                    -> so they're all fitting into the same div 
                  -> this transition is triggered for the hover state of the entire div (around all three of them)
                    -> the width of that div remains the same 

              This was done with a transition not a keyframe 
                -> two methods of adding in animations were listed on the OpenClassrooms platform -> keyframes and transitions 
                -> transitions were used for the green tick animations on the choice cards 
                -> transitions are used whenever there is a trigger event for that animation, and with keyframes a lot of the time the user 
                    interacting with the element doesn't trigger the animation 
                  -> the trigger event for an animation created using keyframes is often less involved with the user (e.g, a page reload)
                  -> compare this to an animation created using transitions <- the hover state of the entire choice card for this is (in this 
                      case) the trigger event 
                -> the width of the entire choice card is always the same 
                  -> the trigger event is when the mouse hovers anywhere over that choice card
                  -> so we have two states <- the entire choice card is being hovered over, or it's not being hovered over 
                  -> we are transitioning the green icon under either of those conditions 
                  -> we are adding in a transition to get from the first state to the second, and then another to get from the second state to the 
                      first 

              The right margins of the green tick element are being transitioned  
                -> the element being transitioned was placed in a div
                -> we are transitioning the margins of that element, during the hover state of the entire choice card 
                -> that element is given negative right margins -> which move it out the right of the choice card
                -> in the hover state for the entire choice card, the right margins of this element are being transitioned to 0 
                -> in other words -> it's being transitioned from out the right of the card, to be in it 
                -> we are transitioning the right margins of that element 
                -> when they transition to 0, the entire green div fits into the choice card 
                  -> the reduction in space which is given by transiting the entire green div back into the choice card (and not off the right of 
                      it) gets taken out of the left most element in that choice card -> chose with was set to auto 
                  -> in other words -> in this case transitioning in the green div onto that choice card won't result in an overall change in the 
                      width of the choice card
                    -> the green div was placed off the right of the choice card to begin with 
                    -> and then when it's added in there is an automatic reduction in width of the first element in that choice card 
                    -> so overall the width of the entire card stays the same
                -> in other words, when the entire choice card is in its hover state -> then we are transitioning the right margins of the green 
                    div to 0 
                  -> this way the green div now fits into the choice card
                  -> in its normal state, we give this div negative margins, in order to transition it off of the right of the choice card completely 
                  -> and then when the entire choice card is in the hover state -> we transition the right margin of the green div back to 0, so the 
                      entire thing fits onto one page

                  -> each of these menu choices is placed on its own card (one card with the green animation, one dish option) <- this is called 
                      a choice card
                    -> and there are three of them (in most cases) in each block (starter / main / desserts)
                  -> the previous choice card was for the first option of the starter block 
                    -> the next two choice cards are for the second and third menu options in this starter block
                    -> these two choice cards are the same as the previous one which was deconstructed in the html, except that their content is 
                        different 
                  -> the text content for these cards was provided in a separate txt file included in the initial files for the project 
                    -> these included the image files and the project brief 
                  -> considering that the following two cards are the same as the previous choice card except for its content, to understand how 
                      these individual cards work in more depth -> refer to the comments around the previous choice card

                How these next two cards were combined to produce the starters block 
                  To combine the three starter choices into one block 
                    -> the approach which was used in the previous project was 
                      -> define a div of certain height
                      -> surround the items with that div 
                      -> flex them apart evenly 

                  The approach which was used here was 
                    -> define those choice cards 
                    -> place a div around them 
                    -> use a gap
                      -> rather thanscetting the height of the div which surrounded those cards and then flexing them apart evenly inside it, you 
                          place a div around all of those cards, flex them into a column 
                      -> but instead of giving the larger div which they're placed in a height and then flexing them apart evenly, you don't give 
                          the larger div which they're placed in a height -> you give it a gap property 
                      -> the items inside it aren't spreading apart evenly to fill the height which you give that containing div <- the containing 
                          div is adjusting its height 
                        -> you're telling it what the distance between each element in that containing div is (the gap) -> and then its height 
                            adjusts accordingly 
                        -> the display is still set to flex 
                        -> when you use the gap property, there is no space in between the top of the containing div and a) the top of the first 
                            element inside it and b) the bottom of the last element placed inside it 
                          -> assuming that the elements we're dealing with are flexed into a column (as with this case)

                  Why use a gap rather than the method from the previous project 
                    -> there are four menu pages for this project, and a homepage 
                    -> each of those menu pages has the same blocks (starter, mains and desserts) 
                    -> but the choices (the number of dishes per block) is √variable on each menu 
                    -> in every case, each block contains three dishes -> apart from the Elderflower starters section, which has four
                    -> if the clients add new dishes to their menus, these choices need to be easily addable 
                    -> using a gap in between the elements allows the height of the containing div to automatically adjust to this 
                      -> rather than just flexing apart those elements into a column and spacing them evenly <- then you would have to re-calculate 
                          the height of the entire containing div (rather than having it automatically adjust, which  is what happens when the gap 
                          property is used)
                      -> this seems simple to do at small scales (recalculate the heigh of the containing div and add the elements into the html), 
                          but if we have a lot of different menu pages and a lot of different changes being made to them -> we need a solution which is flexible 
                      -> i.e, the gap property 
                      -> this saves us from having to repeat css / Sass, which is in line with the DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) principle listed 
                          in the course material on the OpenClassrooms platform
                          -> -> the template had to be designed in a way which was flexible
            -->
