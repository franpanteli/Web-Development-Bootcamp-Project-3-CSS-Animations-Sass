		-> there are four menu pages it needs to be done for 
		-> you would expect it to be around the beige sections of the webpage -> take that class and apply it to the entire webpage 
		-> the trigger is the back arrow being clicked on
	-> checking what we have matches the brief 
	-> booking and preparing for the assessment
