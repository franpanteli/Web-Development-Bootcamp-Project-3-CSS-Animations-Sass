#1 ORGANISE THIS TO DO LIST <- THIS ENTIRE THING IS FROM NOW UNTIL THE END OF THE PROJECT 
#2 TAKE ACTION -> THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS SPELL CHECK THE COMMENTS FOR THE KITCHEN WEST MENU

  -> the transition needs to target the entire page 
      -> the transitions should be around the entire page, not just the section in the middle 
          <- those transitions are for out and in of the page (not just in) -> so there's one 
          playing it forwards and one playing it backwards 
      -> you could recompile the Sass and make those changes 
	-> if you change this for one of the menu pages and get it to work, then it needs to be changed for the other three
	-> there was a class which did this -> that entire thing only plays the animation forward, and it was placed around he beige section 
		-> check if this is still around the beige section, which class it is -> then applying it to the entire page
		-> the trigger for the out -> should be the back arrow being clicked on 
		-> double check this has comments around it -> can't remember writing about the font awesome icon with the link around it 

  -> checking what we have matches the brief 
      -> then emailing the mentor 
      -> then booking and preparing for the assessment <- the writeup for the third project 
          readme after this
-> update the GitHub readme -> also with the flashcards for the project etc after the oral assessment 


-> check the heart at the top of the Kitchen West menu works -> if not paste it in from one of the meny pages, but change its content in the pasted version and leave the comments in the Kitchen West html file unedited 
-> spell check the comments on the Kitchen West menu html file 
-> media queries for the title at the top / the title at the top?
-> the transition should be for the entire page <- just work with the compiled css
-> also check then new label widths 
-> the url of the page should be fine to check, it's been committed
