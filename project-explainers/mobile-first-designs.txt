This txt file contains my notes on the webpage called "Mobile First Design: What it is and How to Implement it" by Browser Stack. This was included as a resource for further reading in the milestone guide OF the third project in the bootcamp. The URL for this page (to date) is https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-implement-mobile-first-design

Note contents <- MOBILE FIRST DESIGN 
#1 Context 
#2 Why mobile first design is important 
#3 How to implement a mobile-first approach 
#4 Best practices when implementing a mobile first approach
#5 Conclusion 

#1 Context 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> the third project in the bootcamp is a mobile first web application <- the second was only for desktops and large desktops 
	-> this also included Sass (the second project only included html and css)
-> this website (resource) is on how to create mobile first designs
	-> the code for the mobile version of the webpage is created first -> and then the desktop (rather than the other way round)
		-> the same webpage has to have mobile and desktop versions

#2 Why mobile first design is important 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> for customer engagement <- most people look at webpages (54%) on their mobiles 
	-> mobile users have overtaken desktop users 
	-> smart phone usage -> 3 hours and 15 minutes a day on average 
	-> younger people are using them more frequently -> people are shifting from desktop to mobile 
-> accessing the web 
-> mobile first design is when the mobile version of the webpages are created first -> and then this is expanded to the desktop and tablet versions 
-> sketching the version of the webpage for smaller versions first 
	-> removing parts of the webpage which aren't necessary, but which are there on desktop versions 
		-> before most people had mobiles, webpages were designed for desktops 
		-> then you would have to scale the desktop versions of the webpages down to mobile versions (graceful degradation / desktop first)
			-> this degrades the appearance of webpages -> because they look better if you design the website for the smallest screen sizes and then add more features as you scale them up 
			-> rather than scaling down a desktop version and taking features off of it for the mobile version -> it's easier to start by designing the mobile version and add features as it's scaled up to the desktop version 

#3 How to implement a mobile-first approach 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> they're using an example of a restaurant menu -> on a mobile web app 
-> they first do a mobile mockup
	-> there is a wireframe of the webpage (a drawing of the different features of this menu web app, based off of what the customers would be looking for)
		-> in this case it's the details of the Restaurant 
		-> and the wireframe is for the mobile version of the web app -> in other words, they've done the mobile wireframe first (rather than designing its desktop version first)
-> then they do a tablet mockup  
	-> there is more information on the tablet version of the site -> since people using larger screen sizes are more likely to be at home where they have more time to go through that information 
		-> in this case it's information about the chefs for the menu site, options to make reservations 
-> and then in the desktop version there's a lot more information 
	-> this is designed last <- it has the most information and more people use mobiles (but people will still use it)
	-> in this case it's making reservations, images or other events there, the designer and blog posts

#4 Best practices when implementing a mobile first approach
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> prioritise page content 
	-> content is the most important thing 
	-> the most critical elements need to be the most visible ones in the mobile versions of the webpages 
-> intuitive navigation 
	-> navigation draws and hand burger menus
	-> speed and intuition 
	-> SpeedLab by BrowserStack <- this is a resource which gives you a speed score out of 100 for desktop and mobile platforms 
		-> you are testing the speed of the webpage which you've designed 
		-> this tool gives you a report based off of the webpage with desktop and mobile scores, navigation timing, API and a page resourcing summary / improvement points for the performance of the webpage 
-> avoid disruptive pop-ups on the mobile version of the webpage 
	-> pop-ups can include adverts
	-> you have to only provide users with information that they're looking for 
-> test the webpage on real devices under real conditions 
	-> test the performance of the page on actual devices 
	-> to test if it's rendering correctly 
	-> testing the rendering of the webpage on a lot of different screen sizes / devices 
	-> BrowserStack has a "real device cloud" service 
		-> these are notes on this article -> and the article is from BrowserStack (they are advertising their own products) 
		-> this one is used to test the performance of the webpage for different types of devices (mobile etc) and browsers under different CPU resources etc 
	-> BrowserStack Live and App Live <- for cross browser testing 
		-> you can view the page across different browser types and devices -> to see if it renders correctly on those specific devices 
		-> these are tools you can use to test the responsiveness of the webpage (under different device sizes and for different browsers)

#5 Conclusion 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> globally, devices are becoming more mobile -> so the mobile versions of webpages are designed first
-> this will make sure that those webpages follow more future proof designs 
-> the mobile audience is prioritised
