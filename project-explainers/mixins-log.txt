Two mixins (styling functions) were defined for repeated elements used throughout the project. All of these mixins were defined in the _mixins.scss file. These definitions were imported into the partials where they were used and called via the @include directive. A log of the places these mixins were used throughout the project is found below:  

-> the first mixin defined was the 'buttonStyles' mixin, which was used in two places 
	-> the pages scss file for the four restaurant pages in the project <- to add buttons into those pages
	-> the header html file -> for button on the header of the index.html file in the project homepage
-> the second of these is the 'textEllipsis' mixin, which is used three times in the pages sass file for the project
	-> this is targeting the use of ellipsis in the menu pages for the project -> there are four of these pages 
		-> five html pages total, four which are the same based off of the Kitchen West template 
		-> and then the other which is the project homepage 
	-> there are three uses of this mixin in this pages sass file 
		-> for the choice card (aka the menu option) text
		-> for the dish titles 
		-> for the dish descriptions 
	-> and each of those uses are targeting the pages scss file -> which is for the four menu pages (not the project homepage)
